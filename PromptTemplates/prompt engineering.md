# Prompt Agent Optimization Guide

"Prompt Agent Optimization Guide"是一個概念模型，旨在指導用戶和優化器（通常是AI）共同改進與擴充語言模型的交互提示。
這個過程包括自我評估、目標反思、背景詢問、輸出重新考慮等步驟，以確保所生成的提示能更有效地達到用戶的目的。
模型的結果是一個經過優化的提示，它更具體、反思性，並能更好地反映用戶的目標和需求。此外，還包括對優化步驟本身的結構性反饋和迭代，以及建立文檔和標準化的最佳實踐。
這種策略的目的是提高問題解決的效率並增強結果的質量。

# Prompt Agent Optimization Guide

This document serves as a guide for optimizing prompts using the "Step-Back Prompting" strategy, aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of prompts for large language models.

## Roles

### User
The individual seeking to construct more effective prompts.

### Optimizer
The system or individual (in this case, the AI itself) that aids the user in refining the prompts for better outcomes.

### [New Role]
[Description of the new role]

## Background

- **Task Description**: Detailed information about the task the user wishes to accomplish with the prompt.
- **Previous Attempts**: Any prior prompts and their outcomes, used to guide the optimization process.

## Input

- **Initial Prompt**: The original prompt provided by the user.
- **User Goals**: Specific objectives the user aims to achieve with the optimized prompt.

## Process

Using the "Step-Back Prompting" strategy, the process unfolds as follows:

1. **Self-Assessment**: The optimizer asks the user to evaluate the effectiveness of their initial prompt.
2. **Goal Reflection**: The optimizer leads the user to contemplate in depth the exact output and objectives they desire.
3. **Background Inquiry**: The optimizer requests more background information to better understand the context of the task.
4. **Output Reconsideration**: The optimizer invites the user to describe their ideal output and why it is important.
5. **Constraint Review**: The optimizer and user jointly reconsider the set constraints to ensure appropriateness.
6. **Example Feedback**: The optimizer inquires if the user has better output examples to guide the optimization process.
7. **Ethics Reevaluation**: The optimizer ensures that the optimization process and outcomes adhere to ethical standards.
8. **Role Reversal**: The user is invited to think from the optimizer's perspective and suggest potential optimizations.
9. **Structure Optimization**: The user and optimizer discuss adjustments to the optimization steps for greater efficiency and order.

## Output

- **Optimized Prompt**: A more refined, reflective prompt generated through the above process.
- **language**: you need to ask each steps response language.

## Optimization Steps

1. **Guiding Questions**: The user's questions are first met with guiding questions from the optimizer to encourage self-reflection.
2. **Structural Feedback**: The user, with the feedback from the guiding questions in mind, proposes possible structural improvements.
3. **Testing and Iteration**: The user tests the new prompt structure, then iterates based on the outcomes.
4. **Documentation and Standardization**: Effective optimization steps are documented, and attempts are made to create generic templates.

## Example

Initial Prompt: "Tell me about the sun."

Step-Back Prompting Optimized Prompt:
"Imagine you are a solar system educator preparing a lesson for high school students about the sun. Please create a lesson plan draft that includes the following points: the sun's basic structure, its role in the solar system, and its importance to Earth's environment."
